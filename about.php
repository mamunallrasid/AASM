                            <p class="mb-30 fs-5">Botanical garden is a place where numerous plants are collected, cultivated and exhibited floral diversity. It is a living repository of wide number of plant species grown together under the same ecological conditions and contain taxonomically and ecologically diverse flora. Establishment of botanical garden in an institute serves the purpose of education, research, sustainable use, conservation of genetic recourses, plant based products as well as recreation. On the other hand, it plays an important role in the ex situ conservation of many rare, threatened as well as most wildly grown medicinally important plant species found in our surrounding. Botanical garden provides the important link between the conversationalist and researcher, and between the neighbouring communities and the pharmaceutical industries.</p>

                                            <p>In current scenario, use of plants has been increasing economically due to growing demand of herbal medicine in the domestic and global markets and pharmaceutical industries. In the contemporary world, numbers of species of plants have been facing threats or have become completely extinct from the world because of pollution and climate change, urbanization, industrialization, over exploitation or unscientific methods of harvesting and destruction of natural habitat. Consequently, it is a huge challenge to us. Conservation (both ex situ and in situ) is the only way to retain the natural wealth by sustaining the existing botanical gardens and further establishment of new botanical gardens.</p>

                        <p class="mb-40" style="font-family:Lucida Console,Courier New,monospace;">In the year of 1973, Prof. Ajit Kumar Das, Dept. of Mathematics of the erstwhile Raiganj College (University College) died in a bus accident at Kishanganj in Bihar, while returning from the University of North Bengal after completion of his official duty. Exactly ten years later, in 1983, Prof. Amiya Kumar Bhattacharya, Dept. of Mathematics, Prof. Sharmila Bhattacharya, Dept. of Philosophy and Prof. Mayabi Ghosh, Dept. of Zoology passed away in a tragic bus accident caused by fire in their bus near Palashi, Murshidabad, while returning from their native place to the Raiganj College (University College). The authority of erstwhile Raiganj College (University College) had taken a unique decision that a garden will be established as a tribute to the memory of those four professors and the garden will be named as AASM garden (as an acronym of the first alphabet of the deceased professors and would be a garden of rare medicinal and aromatic plants).
                        under the president-ship of the then Honâ€™ble Vice-Chancellor, University of North Bengal. Prof. Indu Lal Saha, Dept. of Physics, erstwhile Raiganj College (University College) shouldered the major responsibility to shape the garden during the first decade of its establishment. Department of Botany, erstwhile Raiganj College (University College) was given major accountability for advice and technical knowledge for collection, propagation and conservation of medicinal and aromatic plants. Since then the garden has becomes a conservation centre of many medicinal and aromatic plants as well as rare and threatened flora of the district West Dinajpur (now North and South Dinajpur). Initially the garden was run by the financial contribution of students of erstwhile Raiganj College (University College). The University College had a total area of about 13.62 acres, from which a small area of about 1.5 acres was marked for the garden.The AASM garden was established on 21st February, 1984 within the campus of erstwhile Raiganj College (University College).3rd February, 2015 the Raiganj College (University College) has been up gradated as Raiganj University as an autonomous State University under Government of West Bengal (Established by an Act No. XXVI of 2014 of West Bengal State Legislature). Later on, the first honourable Vice-Chancellor of Raiganj University, Prof. (Dr.) Anil Bhuimali played a key role for the development and sustenance of the garden. Due to his keen interest recently the garden has been renovated and beautified with the financial assistance from the Department of Higher Education, Govt. West Bengal.
